Test 1: Register Write and Read
PASSTest 2: ADD Operation (R3 = R1 + R2)
  R3 = 0x1E
PASS
Test 3: SUB Operation (R4 = R2 - R1)
  R4 = 0xA
PASS
Test 4: AND Operation (R5 = R1 AND 0x0F)
  R5 = 0xA
PASS
Test 5: OR Operation (R7 = R1 OR 0xF0)
  R7 = 0xFA
PASS
Test 6: Memory Write (mem[0] = 0x12345678)
  Memory[0] = 0x12345678
PASS
Test 7: Memory Read (R12 = mem[0])
  R12 = 0x12345678
PASS
Test 8: Sequential Operations
  Step 1: R13 = 5 + 3
    Result: 0x8
  Step 2: R16 = R13 * 2 (via ADD R13 + R13)
    Result: 0x10
  Step 3: mem[10] = R16
    Result: 0x10
  Step 4: R18 = mem[10]
    Result: 0x10 (expected 0x10 = 16)
PASS
